# State Management - Getx

This is a basic example using the same code of App State Management (Singleton or Bloc or Providers previously) using a wonderful package called GetX. This approach is another option if the app complexity is really high. Another good option is using providers or bloc.

This package has not only State Management capability but also many other features like Route Management, GetMaterialApp, Snackbar, App Theme, and others.

- For more details: [GetX package](https://pub.dev/packages/get)
